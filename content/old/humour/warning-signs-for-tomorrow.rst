This might mark me as exceptionally nerdy, but I just love this set of
`warning signs for
tomorrow <http://lifeboat.com/ex/warning.signs.for.tomorrow>`__, dug up
via the instapundit.

Some favourites:

|Ubiquitous Surveillance Warning|

This is the scary one -- it should probably be posted in most banks,
office buildings, *my* building, and Britain.

|Nonstandard Spacetime Warning|

Perhaps those times when you've got a project due the next morning *"all
of a sudden"* even though you *never* let things sit that long?

|Lack of Internet Connectivity Warning|

My life, according to Shaw, some days.

|Existential Warning|

I can just picture this hanging in an effete coffee shop, over books by
Sartre, being studiedly ignored by a gaggle of pseudo-intellectual
first-year philosophy students.

|Congnitive Hazard Warning|

Seen over the magazine rack containing US, Cosmo, and Maxim.

|Autonomous Device Warning|

I think I should get a shirt with this one on it ;)
