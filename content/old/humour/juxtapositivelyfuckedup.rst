| Just a brief aside... having seen this twice now (Both with the same
  company) I
| can \_not\_ get over the bizarre juxtaposition between the cutesy
  CGI-ish ferret
| creatures and the
  `movie <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_for_a_Dream>`__ for which
  this song was
  `written <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Mansell>`__.
