Here's more help for anyone suffering growing pains using the new range
of browsers:

If you get strange error messages clicking on links from places like
Outlook while using FireFox to browse,
"this":http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2004/06/18-186.html may be the
solution for you.

One potential serious flaw in FireFox is detailed
`here <http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1621463,00.asp>`__ and its
fix is
`here <http://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=154>`__.
It's a nasty one, but it's still easy enough to fix and it's not likely
to be a problem for you. (Info on this one via `Don
Park <http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=33fc27a0-a44e-45db-8d2c-47ec3f84ee74>`__)

I have added easy links down the sidebar to get these two programs, but
here are pretty picture links for the moment:

| FireFox: |Get Firefox|
| Thunderbird: |Get Thunderbird|
