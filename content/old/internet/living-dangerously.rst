If only the north american ads would be like
`this <http://www.playingsafely.co.uk/12stisofchristmas/12-STIs.html>`__.
The URL really \_looks\_ like it's legit, and this has got to be the
funniest/sickest public service announcement i have \_ever\_ seen.

So, if PSA(Public Service Announcements)s were always like this, do you
think people would listen more?
