The above is true, to be sure.
`Catblogging <http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&safe=off&q=catblogging&btnG=Search>`__,
basically a modernized version of homepages with pictures of the
writer's cat, is everywhere. A weekly thing at some sites, a constant at
others.

Wankery.

*However*, in the name of being a wanker myself, here's a couple of pics
Char and I took of our weirdest cat last night. Tell me, has anyone ever
seen a cat do this?
