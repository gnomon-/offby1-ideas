The author of a piece of software that i have used in the past to work
on this site -- [TopStyle](http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.asp)
-- wrote a fairly thought-provoking
[article](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/01/on_piracy.html) on
piracy a couple of days ago.

Now, i acknowledge that i am one of the people he talks about, and --
let's face it -- i don't really have a justification for it. I know that
my use of my computer would be less enjoyable without some of the tools
that i have ... _acquired_ ... over the years, and the essential
hypocrisy of my continuing to do so, in the face of my own philosophical
objections to this sort of thing. My only defense is that, at such time
as i am finished education and am making a living in the computer
industry, i intend, more and more firmly, to pay for, register, and/or
purchase each and every piece of software that i have enjoyed so much
over the years.

Cold comfort, i know, for the shareware authors of today who are not
benefiting from my patronage.

However, [this](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/onPiracy) moron [ref]Moron is a limited term, here - the man in question is
actually quite intelligent - i'm referring to _ethical intelligence_
here, not pure smarts. I'm actually really impressed with his
accomplishments.[/ref] here just amazes me. How he can come up with gems like
"Nick has no innate right to have people pay for his software, just as I
have no right to ask people to pay for use of my name." is completely
beyond me - It shows a level of intellectual dishonesty that puts my own
to shame here. This ... kid writes software and calls himself a hacker,
but seems to be of the opinion that software writers don't have the
_right_ to restrict the uses to which their creations are put..

I wish i could write more, but damn, i'm mad about this...

#### Update:

I guess it wasn't clear - the first link is to an article by the author
of TopStyle and FeedDemon - software that i use. The second link is to a
full reprint / comment on said article by Aaron Swartz, and this is the
one that made me mad. Sorry about the confusion.

#### Update 2:

Further comment and _very_ interesting discussion of this over at [Don
Park's](http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=7a592614-ff21-4817-b7c0-3ea9a7007122)
weblog, as well. I'm following this one, too, since it seems to be
covering more or less the same ground as we are here.

#### Update 3 (_Much_ later):

And I was reminded of this yet again by a
[Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=121633) article today
(Sept 13 2004) that linked to Brad's postings. Regrettably, they ignored
Aaron's response, although predictably the posters on /. vented more or
less what he did.
