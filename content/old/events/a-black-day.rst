About two hours ago, as i write this, the NASA space shuttle Columbia
lost contact with mission control while coming in for a landing. As of
this writing, it is known (`CNN
link <http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/space/02/01/shuttle.columbia/index.html>`__)
that the space shuttle, with seven astronauts on board, broke up above
central Texas at approximately 9 AM EST.

What more can I say?

The crew of the *Columbia* are Americans Col. `Rick
Husband <http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/bio_husband.html>`__,
USAF, commander; Comdr. `William
McCool <http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/bio_mccool.html>`__, USN,
pilot; Lt. Col. `Michael
Anderson <http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/bio_mike_anderson.html>`__,
USAF, payload commander; Capt. `David
Brown <http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/bio_david_brown.html>`__,
USN, mission specialist; `Dr. Laurel
Clark <http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/bio_laurel_clark.html>`__,

**Update**:

It has turned up in my readings of commentary on this event that a CBC
Newsworld interviewer took this event as an opportunity to whip the
"American Arrogance" horse again (from `The Ghost of a
Flea <http://ghostofaflea.blogspot.com/2003_01_26_ghostofaflea_archive.html#88377587>`__):

    CBC Newsworld just interviewed writer Robert Sawyer for his
    reflections on the shuttle program and potential causes of the
    disaster. The Newsworld interviewer asked Sawyer whether the cause
    was "arrogance" on the part of the U.S. government. (Sawyer said
    no.) This is one of the most odious questions I can imagine. It took
    minutes for the CBC to twist a tragedy into a politically motivated
    theatre of hate. Talk about manufacturing consent.

I don't know how to respond to this... CBC is supposedly the Canadian
perspective. But that's just beyond the pale. I am going to reserve
further comment until i see the interview, or read a transcript thereof,
for myself, but...

Words fail me.

But they didn't fail Jeff Fecke (`Blog of the Moderate
Left <http://moderateleft.blogspot.com/>`__):

    Well, if this is arrogance -- exploring space for science, pushing
    the envelope of the human experience, doing what our species has
    always done -- then I support it. If it is arrogant to want to
    learn, we are arrogant. If it is arrogant to want to explore, we are
    arrogant. If it is arrogant to risk our lives for the possibility of
    a better future for all mankind, we are arrogant.

    Mankind is arrogant. We believe foolish things--that we may one day
    cure cancer, that we may one day develop new forms of energy, that
    we may one day walk on Mars. We believe these foolish things, and we
    dedicate ourselves to achieving them. How ridiculous. How arrogant.

    And people die for these things. And people are injured for life.
    The astronauts of Apollo 1, and the Challenger, and now, sadly, the
    Columbia have died for the arrogant belief that we can be more than
    we are, that we can walk on the moon, that we can touch the stars.

    This arrogance is not American in nature. It is human. It is human
    arrogance that led us from the veldt of Africa to the ice-bound
    wastelands of Europe, across the Bering Strait into the Americas,
    across oceans to Australia and Oceana. It is human arrogance that
    leads thousands of people to live in the frigid environment of
    Antarctica, that leads explorers to dive miles under the oceans in
    bathyscapes.

    This arrogance is our species' birthright. It is what defines us. If
    we were not arrogant, we never would have flown. We never would have
    domesicated the horse. We would have died in the caves, unwilling to
    strive to be more than we are.

    So call us arrogant for building the space shuttle. Call the men and
    woman who gave their lives today arrogant for believing they could
    fly to space and return to tell about it. But don't call us wrong.
    For this arrogance defines humanity. And I would rather our species
    be arrogant than afraid.
