It's something I've dreamed of my whole life. It's something I may yet
see in my life, and it's something for which I would sell anything, give
anything to see. The passion with which these men speak of the moon, the
look in their eyes as they remember the experience of landing, walking

something I empathize with, even if I can't \_know\_ the whole truth of
it.
